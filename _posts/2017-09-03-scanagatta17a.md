title: Improved Local Search in Bayesian Networks Structure Learning
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: 'We present a novel approach for score-based structure learning of Bayesian
  network, which couples an existing ordering-based algorithm for structure optimization
  with a novel operator for exploring the neighborhood of a given order in the space
  of the orderings. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performances in data sets
  containing thousands of variables. '
