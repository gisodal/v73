title: Causal Learning and Machine Learning
section: Invited Papers
abstract: "Can we find the causal direction between two variables? How can we make
  optimal predictions\r in the presence of distribution shift? We are often faced
  with such causal modeling\r or prediction problems. Recently, with the rapid accumulation
  of huge volumes of data,\r both causal discovery, i.e., learning causal information
  from purely observational data, and\r machine learning are seeing exciting opportunities
  as well as great challenges. This talk will\r be focused on recent advances in causal
  discovery and how causal information facilitates\r understanding and solving certain
  problems of learning from heterogeneous data. In particular,\r I will talk about
  basic approaches to causal discovery and address practical issues\r in causal discovery,
  including nonstationarity or heterogeneity of the data and existence of\r measurement
  error. Finally, I will discuss why and how underlying causal knowledge helps\r in
  learning from heterogeneous data when the i.i.d. assumption is dropped, with transfer\r
  learning? as a particular example.\r "
