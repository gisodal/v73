title: Hyperparameter sensitivity revisited
section: Invited Papers
abstract: "The BDeu scoring criterion for learning Bayesian network structures is
  known to be very\r sensitive to the equivalent sample size hyper-parameter. Recently
  some authors have suggested\r alternative Bayesian scoring criteria that appear
  to behave better than BDeu. So\r is the problem solved? We will review the problem
  and suggested solutions and present\r empirical assessment of the current situation.\r "
