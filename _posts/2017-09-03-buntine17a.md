title: Backoff methods for estimating parameters of a Bayesian network
section: Invited Papers
abstract: "Various authors have highlighted inadequacies of BDeu type scores and this
  problem is\r shared in parameter estimation. Basically, Laplace estimates work poorly,
  at least because\r setting the prior concentration is challenging. In 1997, Freidman
  et al suggested a simple\r backoff approach for Bayesian network classifiers (BNCs).
  Backoff methods dominate in\r in n-gram language models, with modified Kneser-Ney
  smoothing, being the best known,\r and a Bayesian variant exists in the form of
  Pitman-Yor process language models from\r Teh in 2006. In this talk we will present
  some results on using backoff methods for Bayes\r network classifiers and Bayesian
  networks generally. For BNCs at least, the improvements\r are dramatic and alleviate
  some of the issues of choosing too dense a network.\r "
