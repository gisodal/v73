title: Restricted Quasi Bayesian Networks as a Prototyping Tool for Computational
  Models of Individual Cortical Areas
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: "We propose \\textit{restricted quasi Bayesian networks} as an efficient
  prototyping tool for designing computational models of individual cortical areas
  of the brain.\r Restricted quasi Bayesian networks are simplified Bayesian networks\r
  that only distinguish probability value 0 from other values.\r Using our tool, it
  is possible to concentrate on the essential part of model design and efficiently
  construct prototypes.\r We demonstrate that restricted quasi Bayesian networks actually
  work well as a prototyping tool by implementing a syntactic parser for an ambiguous
  English sentence."
