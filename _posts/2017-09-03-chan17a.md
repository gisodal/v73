title: Incorporating Uncertain Evidence Into Arithmetic Circuits Representing Probability
  Distributions
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: Arithmetic circuits have been used as tractable representations of probability
  distributions, either generated from models such as Bayesian networks, sum-product
  networks and Probability Sentential Decision Diagrams, or directly from data. An
  interesting question is how we can incorporate uncertain evidence, which specifies
  that the marginal probabilities of a variable has to undergo certain changes, directly
  into an arithmetic circuit and then perform reasoning on it to compute the probability
  distribution after incorporating this uncertain evidence. In this paper, we show
  that we can incorporate uncertain evidence on a variable by setting indicators of
  this variable in the arithmetic circuit to non-negative values based on the likelihood
  ratios in Pearl's method of virtual evidence and the current marginal probabilities
  of this variable. For tractable computation of these marginal probabilities, the
  arithmetic circuit has to satisfy the properties of decomposability and smoothness,
  and we show that an algorithm using a downward pass can compute these marginal probabilities
  for all single variables. We show a procedure of how to incorporate virtual evidence,
  including multiple pieces of virtual evidence.
