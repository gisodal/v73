title: Consistent Learning Bayesian Networks with Thousands of Variables
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: 'We have already proposed a constraint-based learning Bayesian network method
  using Bayes factor. Since a conditional independence test using Bayes factor has
  consistency, the learning method improves the learning accuracy of the traditional
  constraint-based learning methods. Additionally, the method is expected to learn
  larger network structures than the traditional methods do because it greatly improves
  computational efficiency. However, its expected benefits have not been demonstrated
  empirically. This report describes some experiments related to the learning of large
  network structures. Results show that the proposed method can learn surprisingly
  huge networks with thousands of variables. '
