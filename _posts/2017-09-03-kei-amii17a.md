title: On the Sizes of Decision Diagrams Representing the Set of All Parse Trees of
  a Context-free Grammar
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: "  In this paper, we analyze the size of decision diagrams (DD) representing
  the set of all parse trees of a context-free grammar (CFG).\r CFG is widely used
  in the field of natural language processing and bioinformatics to estimate the hidden
  structures of sequence data.\r A decision diagram is a data structure that represents
  a Boolean function in a concise form. By using DDs to represent the set of all parse
  trees, we can efficiently perform many useful operations over the parse trees, such
  as finding trees that satisfy additional constraints and finding the best parse
  tree.\r Since the time complexity of these operations depends on DD size, selecting
  an appropriate DD variant is important.\r Experiments on a simple CFG show that
  the Zero-suppressed Sentential Decision Diagram (ZSDD) is better than other DDs;
  we also give theoretical upper bounds on ZSDD size."
