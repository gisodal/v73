title: Fast Compilation of s-t Paths on a Graph for Counting and Enumeration
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: "In this paper, we propose a new method to compile $s$-$t$ simple paths
  on a graph\r using a new compilation method called merging frontier based search.
  Recently, Nishino et al. proposed a top-down construction algorithm,\r which compiles
  $s$-$t$ simple paths into a Zero-suppressed SDD (ZSDD),  and they showed that this
  method is more efficient than simpath by Knuth.\r However, since the method of Nishino
  et al. uses ZSDD as a tractable representation, it requires complicated steps for
  compilation. In this paper, we propose z-st-d-DNNF, which is a super set of ZSDD.\r
  By using this method instead of ZSDD, we show that more efficient $s$-$t$ simple
  paths compilation can be realized.\r "
