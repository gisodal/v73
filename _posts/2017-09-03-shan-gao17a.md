title: Fast Message Passing Algorithm Using ZDD-Based Local Structure Compilation
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: "Compiling Bayesian Networks (BNs) into secondary structures to implement
  efficient exact inference is a hot topic in probabilistic modeling. \r One class
  of algorithms to compile BNs is to transform the BNs into junction tree structures
  utilizing the conditional dependency in the network. \r Performing message passing
  on the junction tree structure, we can calculate marginal probabilities for any
  variables in the network efficiently. \r However, the message passing algorithm
  does not consider the local structure in the network. Since the ability to exploit
  local structure to avoid redundant calculations has a significant impact on exact
  inference,\r in this article, we propose a fast message passing algorithm by exploiting
  local structure using Zero-suppressed Binary Decision Diagrams (ZDDs).\r We convert
  all the components used in message passing algorithm into Multi-linear Functions
  (MLFs), and then compile them into compact representation using ZDDs.\r We show
  that message passing on ZDDs can work more efficient than the conventional message
  passing algorithm on junction tree structures on some benchmark networks although
  it may be too memory consuming for some larger instances.\r "
