title: Learning probability by comparison
section: Invited Papers
abstract: "Learning probability by probabilistic modeling is a major task in statistical
  machine learning\r and it has traditionally been supported by maximum likelihood
  estimation applied to\r generative models or by a local maximizer applied to discriminative
  models. In this talk, we\r introduce a third approach, an innovative one that learns
  probability by comparing probabilistic\r events. In our approach, we give the ranking
  of probabilistic events and the system\r learns a probability distribution so that
  the ranking is well respected. We implemented\r this approach in PRISM, a logic-based
  probabilistic programming language, and conducted\r learning experiments with real
  data for models described by PRISM programs."
