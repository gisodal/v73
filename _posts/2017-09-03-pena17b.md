title: Learning Causal AMP Chain Graphs
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: Andersson-Madigan-Perlman chain graphs were originally introduced to represent
  independence models. They have recently been shown to be suitable for representing
  causal models with additive noise. In this paper, we present an algorithm for learning
  causal chain graphs. The algorithm builds on the ideas by \citet{Hoyeretal.2009},
  i.e. it exploits the nonlinearities in the data to identify the direction of the
  causal relationships. We also report experimental results on real-world data.
