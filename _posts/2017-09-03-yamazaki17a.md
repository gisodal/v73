title: Hidden Node Detection between Two Observable Nodes Based on Bayesian Clustering
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: "The structure learning is one of the main concerns in studies of the Bayesian
  networks.\r In the present paper, we consider the network consisting of both observable
  and hidden nodes,\r and propose a method to investigate the existence of a hidden
  node between two observable nodes,\r which is the model selection problem between
  the networks with and without the middle hidden node.\r When the network includes
  a hidden node, it has been known that there are singularities in the parameter space,\r
  and the Fisher information matrix is not positive definite.\r Then, the many conventional
  criteria for the structure learning based on the Laplace approximation do not work.\r
  The proposed method is based on the Bayesian clustering,\r and its asymptotic property
  justifies the result; the redundant labels are eliminated and the simplest structure
  is detected\r even if there are singularities."
