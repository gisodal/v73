title: Few-to-few Cross-domain Object Matching
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: "  Cross-domain object matching refers to the task of inferring unknown\r
  alignment between objects in two data collections that do not have a\r shared data
  representation. In recent years several methods have\r been proposed for solving
  the special case that assumes each object\r is to be paired with exactly one object,
  resulting\r in a constrained optimization problem over permutations. A related\r
  problem formulation of cluster matching seeks to match a cluster of\r objects in
  one data set to a cluster of objects in the other set,\r which can be considered
  as many-to-many extension of cross-domain\r object matching and can be solved without
  explicit constraints.  In\r this work we study the intermediate region between these
  two special\r cases, presenting a range of Bayesian inference algorithms that work\r
  also for few-to-few cross-domain object matching problems where\r constrained optimization
  is necessary but the optimization domain is\r broader than just permutations. "
