title: Causal Effect Identification in Alternative Acyclic Directed Mixed Graphs
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: 'Alternative acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) are graphs that may allow
  causal effect identification in scenarios where Pearl''s original ADMGs may not,
  and vice versa. Therefore, they complement each other. In this paper, we introduce
  a sound algorithm for identifying arbitrary causal effects from alternative ADMGs.
  Moreover, we show that the algorithm is complete for identifying the causal effect
  of a single random variable on the rest. We also show that the algorithm follows
  from a calculus similar to Pearl''s {\it do}-calculus. '
