title: Multiple DAGs Learning with Non-negative Matrix Factorization
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: 'Probabilistic graphical models, e.g., Markov network and Bayesian network
  have been well studied in the past two decades. However, it is still difficult to
  learn a reliable network structure, especially with limited data. Recent works found
  multi-task learning can improve the robustness of the learned networks by leveraging
  data from related tasks. In this paper, we focus on the estimation of Direct Acyclic
  Graph (DAG) of Bayesian network. Most existing multi-task or transfer learning algorithms
  for Bayesian network use the DAG relatedness as an inductive bias in the optimization
  of multiple structures. More specifically, some works firstly find shared hidden
  structures among related tasks, and then treat them as the structure penalties in
  the learning step. However, current works omit the setting that the shared hidden
  structure comes from different parts of different DAGs. Thus, in this paper, the
  Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is employed to learn a parts-based representation
  to mediate this problem. Theoretically, we show the plausibility of our approach.
  Empirically, we show that compared to single task learning, multi-task learning
  is better able to positively identify true edges with synthetic data and real-world
  landmine data. '
