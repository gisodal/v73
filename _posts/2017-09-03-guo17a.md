title: Learning Bayesian Network Parameters with Domain Knowledge and Insufficient
  Data
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: "To improve the learning accuracy of parameters in a Bayesian network (BN)
  from limited\r data, domain knowledge is often incorporated into the learning process
  as parameter con-\r straints. Maximum a posteriori (MAP) based methods that use
  both data and constraints\r have been studied extensively. Among those methods,
  the qualitatively maximum a pos-\r teriori (QMAP) method exhibits high learning
  performance. In the QMAP method, when\r the data are limited, estimation from the
  data often fails to satisfy all the parameter con-\r straints, which makes the overall
  QMAP estimation unreliable. To ensure that the QMAP\r estimation does not violate
  any given parameter constraint and further improve the learn-\r ing accuracy, in
  this paper, we propose a qualitatively maximum a posteriori correction\r (QMAP-C)
  estimation algorithm, which regulates QMAP estimation by replacing the data\r estimation
  with a further constrained estimation. Experiments show that the proposed al-\r
  gorithm outperforms most of the existing parameter learning methods when the parameter\r
  constraints are correct."
