title: An Experimental Analysis of Anytime Algorithms for Bayesian Network Structure
  Learning
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: "Bayesian networks are a widely used graphical model with diverse applications
  in knowledge discovery, classification,\r and decision making. Learning a Bayesian
  network from discrete data can be cast as a combinatorial optimization problem and\r
  thus solved using optimization techniques---the well-known \\emph{score-and-search}
  approach. An important consideration\r when applying a score-and-search method for
  Bayesian network structure learning (BNSL) is its anytime behavior; i.e., how\r
  does the quality of the solution found improve as a function of the amount of time
  given to the algorithm. Previous studies\r of the anytime behavior of methods for
  BNSL are limited by the scale of the instances used in the evaluation and evaluate\r
  only algorithms that do not scale to larger instances. In this paper, we perform
  an extensive evaluation of the\r anytime behavior of the current state-of-the-art
  algorithms for BNSL. Our benchmark instances range from small (instances\r with
  fewer than 20 random variables) to massive (instances with more than 1,500 random
  variables).  We find that a local search\r algorithm based on memetic search dominates
  the performance of other state-of-the-art algorithms when considering anytime behavior."
